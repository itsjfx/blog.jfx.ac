This is just a personal blog for anything I thought worth sharing on the internet! :)

I'm currently a student studying Computer Science in my final year.

I do a few things on the internet sometimes, namely I work on [SteamLevels.com](https://steamlevels.com/r/jfx). In my spare time I work on projects which I generally put on [my GitHub](https://github.com/itsjfx).

I'm also an avid GAMER in my spare time, sometimes I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/itsjfx).

This blog is just a small blog made in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is definitely very cool and fun to use. It's also hosted on GitHub Pages which was very easy to get going (the Staticman integration made it very appealing!). A link to the blog's GitHub repository [is here](https://github.com/itsjfx/blog.jfx.ac).
