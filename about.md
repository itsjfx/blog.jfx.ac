## Me

My name is Thomas and I primarily work as a software engineer mainly interested in backend development or web-based full stack development. Despite this being my primary role, I have experience in Dev Ops, Cloud, IT Infrastructure as an engineer. I also have a vested interest in security and privacy.

For software engineering I have extensive experience working with Meteor.js as a full stack library, and also worked with REST APIs using Flask or Express and tying it in with React or AJAX/jQuery.

My main area of expertise is Node.js, for which I’ve been writing applications in 4 years, but I also have a soft spot for Python, Java, C and C++. I’m also a strong advocate for open source software, so I try to open source any of my modules for the public on [my GitHub](https://github.com/itsjfx).

For my education I have a Bachelor of Computer Science. I have various hobbies such as being into fitness and going to the gym (and I always love to chat about this!), and I'm a big gamer too in my spare time but most days I find myself spending my spare time in VS Code writing up something for a personal project.

As for where ```jfx``` came from, well I thought it sounded and looked cool and *aestheticly pleasing* so I used it and it's stuck ever since. This is my main alias online.

## This blog

This is a dedicated to my rambling thoughts about anything but primarily tech and privacy.

This blog is running off [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is very cool. It's also hosted on GitHub Pages and it uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD in order to allow for custom themes and Gem files (and the latest version of Jekyll). A link to the blog's GitHub repository [is here](https://github.com/itsjfx/blog.jfx.ac).
