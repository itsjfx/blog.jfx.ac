## Me

My name is Thomas or Tom and I work as a Dev Ops engineer primarily touching AWS.

I enjoy writing software in Node.js/TypeScript, Python, and Bash. I try and open-source anything interesting on [my GitHub](https://github.com/itsjfx).

As for where `jfx` came from, I thought it sounded and looked cool and *aestheticly pleasing* so I used it and it's stuck ever since. This is my main alias online.

## This blog

This is a dedicated to my rambling thoughts about anything but primarily tech and privacy.

This blog is running off [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is very cool. A link to the blog's GitHub repository [is here](https://github.com/itsjfx/blog.jfx.ac).
